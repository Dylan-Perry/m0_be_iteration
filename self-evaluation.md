# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?

Oh man - I feel like the 'each' method could be used for SO many things. Updating elements in an array based on certain conditions, filtering out elements, and cleanly/efficiently applying code to many variables/elements without needing a bunch of bespoke code. I'm sure there's tons more I'm not even considering yet due to inexperience.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?

In general, I still need to learn more common methods for handling arrays and array iteration. I'll do this through Turing lessons of course, but I think building some personal projects will help - as well simple googling ("most useful array methods ruby", for example)

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?

Keeping the Turing examples/lesson visible as a reference was the most helpful during this assignment, and this has generally been true for the other assignments as well. Even when I'm semi-confident about syntax or my understanding of the concepts, I find it comforting and helpful to have that reference visible whenever I need it. Almost like it gives me the confidence to experiment.
